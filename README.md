Spell It Out!
Spell It Out! is a kids spelling game geared towards younger, kindergarten-aged kids (3-6). Most video games and apps available on the market are too complicated for younger children, often containing many buttons and commands, or ads and pop-ups that can lead away from the game to other websites. The proposed project, aptly named Spell It Out!, will minimize ‘extras’ on the UI so that it is easy for young children to understand and navigate. The game will be education-based allowing children to practice their spelling skills as well as encouraging letter and word recognition. This is so that parents and caretakers can feel good about allowing their children scree-time, as it is not only fun and engaging, but also educational.
Created using Python and tkinter to create the GUI. This game was made for my Programming Research Language final project.
